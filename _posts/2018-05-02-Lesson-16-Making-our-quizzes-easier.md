This lesson we worked on making our codes easier to function. We took our instructions and first question and made them into functions, then at the top of the page, all we had to do was create another function called main, and put the two functions we'd already made (def_instructions() and def_question1()) into it, then, when we ran the code, it would work, the instructions would run through as normal, followed by question 1. All in all this was a good lesson, because not only did I manage to get all the work done, I also completely understood the idea of making our work into functions making it a lot easier.
