This lesson we carried on making our quizzes, and then we actually started coding them. The method I used was, print("Whatever the question was"), and if a certain answer was typed, then it would add a certain amount of points to the grand total. Same for the other three possible answers.

And then, at the end, if the grand total is between a certain range of scores, the Harry Potter character you're most like is based on what score you got.
