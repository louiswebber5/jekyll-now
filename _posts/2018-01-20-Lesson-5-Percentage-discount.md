This lesson we made sure the basics of our virtual shops worked, because then we could work on and improve on what we'd done to make our shops more sophisticated. To do that, we made some code that made sure we didn’t get a discount if we hadn’t bought 5 items or more. Also, we learnt how to take discount of specific items, (e.g. 30% off gloves), although I didn’t quite get onto that. Also, we made sure our discount worked, so if we typed in 20%,it would times it by 0.8, and so on. And finally, we made sure that the computer worked out what the total price was after the discount.
