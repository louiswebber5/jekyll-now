This lesson, we checked our Github blogs were still working. I edited mine a little bit, by deleting the old posts on it, to make way for new ones. I also updated my 'style.scss'. Once I had gone my blogs working, I started writing my blogs. The only bit of uploading my blog posts that I didn’t remember was the bit on Google Docs, where you have to click on ‘Add-ons’, then ‘Gabriel’, then ‘Start publishing’. After that, you scroll down until you find your repository name, then you click on the dropdown arrow, and tick the box next to ‘Posts’, finally, you click ‘Commit changes’, and then it should have updated your website.
