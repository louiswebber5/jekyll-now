In this lesson I finished my virtual shop, so it had drop down boxes, worked out discount, how many items there are, and what it all added up to. So if I typed 'Socks' it would come up with £5.00, if I clicked 3 it would say the total was £15.00. Then it would work out a discount of 20% and take it away.
