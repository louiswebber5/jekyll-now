This lesson was our first IT lesson. We watched how to make a spreadsheet that had a list of items, and a list of prices. We also learnt how to assign a price to an item, so if we made 'Shoes=£40.00', and then we typed in ‘Shoes’ somewhere else, it immediately assigned it to £40.00. We did this for all the items on our list, and programmed it so it added up the prices and gave us a grand total.
