This lesson we started trying to make our own names, in 3D, using code. At first, I thought this was going to be a difficult challenge, but then realising I could use turtle.forward/backward/right/left, and turtle.penup()/turtle.pendown() or turtle.goto(), I figured out that it was still going to be a bit challenging, it was going to be very time consuming, but on the plus side, at least I understood the basics of how to do it. I started off well, and my knowledge of basic geometry helped me out in working out the angles, and by the end of the lesson, I had achieved a 3D 'L', and a 3D ‘O’. I was very pleased with my progress that lesson.
