This lesson, we moved on from making our own names, and we tried a harder topic. Prime numbers. We started off by making some code for even/odd numbers, which looked a bit like this:

def isEven(N):

    If N%2 == 0:

        Print(N, 'is even')

    Elif N%2 > 0:

        Print(N, 'is odd')

This code, when you typed in any number, would divide it by 2, and if the answer was 0, then it would be even, and if the answer wasn't 0, it would be even. After that, we moved onto prime numbers, and the logic we were given was if you can divide the number by any of the integers up to the square root of the number you’re trying to find out is prime, then the number isn’t prime. I understood the principle, but I didn’t have time to start putting it into code.
