This lesson we finished our work on our virtual shops and moved on to something completely new. First, Mr Tansley wrote some letters on the board: **'ifmmp xpsme', **and we had to figure out what it meant. I was one of the people who got there in the end, and worked out that if you moved a letter forward on each of the letters, it would spell out: **‘hello world’, **which I thought was quite clever. This is called a Caesar Cipher. We went on to Google Sheets, and we attempted to make our own Caesar Ciphers. First, we typed all the letters of the alphabet down one side of the page. Then, we typed the letters corresponding to the normal letters, in my case I put **‘a’** equal to **‘d**’, and **‘b’ **equal to **‘e’, **and so on. Then I made a row for the original text, and a row for the coded text. On the line for the coded text I put in the bit of code: **‘****=VLOOKUP(****E1****,****$A1:$B27****,****2****,****false****)’****  **which means from the list it would find the letter put in original, and change it to a letter 3 letters in front of the original. See if you can work out what this means:
