In this lesson, we were building on our shop spreadsheet, and we learnt how to have discounts, so we had to program it so that if we put 20% discount, then it would multiply the total of all the items by 0.8, which would give 20% off. Also we learnt how to make it so we could only get a certain discount if we had a certain amount of items.
