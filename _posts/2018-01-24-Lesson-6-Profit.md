This lesson we did more work on our virtual shops. We developed them further so that by the end of the lesson most of us had been able to make our virtual shops say how many of each item there were in stock, how many had been bought, and how many of them hadn't been bought. Then, it also added up how much buying all the items in the shop cost, then took it away from the total price, to show how much profit was made. Finally, we worked out how much things like advertising, utilities, and employees would cost, per week and per month, and took that away from the total amount of money to see how much we would make over time.
