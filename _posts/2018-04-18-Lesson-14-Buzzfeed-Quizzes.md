This lesson we started off by looking at and doing some buzzfeeds, and we talked about how they were coded. We figured out that some questions were completely random, and were unlikely to help answer the quiz, however there were some sensible questions, which eventually lead to an outcome, like what our favourite colour is, or something about our personalities. Most of the time they were wrong!

Our task was to make our own buzzfeed. I chose 'Which Harry Potter character are you most like?', and the way I started making it was say the person taking the test chose A, they would have a certain amount of points added, and at the end, the points would be added up, and each person, (e.g. Hermione), would be between  certain numbers of points.
